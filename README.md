# Bootr

**Bootr** ("booter") belongs to niche of bootable containers.

This is an alternative implementation of bootable containers, very
similar to [bootc](https://containers.github.io/bootc/), but doesn't
require OSTree and `systemd`, is not bound solely to Fedora/RedHat and
is designed to be as agnostic as possible.

Main goal and focus is on system updates, using OCI container
mechanisms, being a part of next-generation configuration management
system, relying on containers and Kubernetes.
